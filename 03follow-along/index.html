        <h1>Declarations of Independence</h1>
        <h2>what is says</h2>
        <p>The Declaration of Independence (1776) announces that<strong>the thirteen American colonies</strong> regarded
            themselves as
            independent sovereign states, no longer under British rule. It asserts that "all men are created equal" with
            unalienable rights to <em>"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness," and that governments derive power
                from
                the "consent of the governed".</em></p>

        <h2>why we are upset</h2>
        <p>In the mid-18th century, the relationship between the American colonies and Great Britain soured due to a
            series of economic and political conflicts following the French and Indian War. The British government
            began imposing new policies to pay off massive war debts and exert more direct control, which the
            colonists viewed as an attack on their long-held liberties. </p>

            <li>Taxes were being forced on them they were forced to pay high taxes, such as the Stamp Act and Tea
                Act, without having any say </li>
            <li>They lost their self-government the King dissolved their local legislatures and cancelled their
                charters, meaning they could no
                longer make their own laws or govern themselves. </li>
